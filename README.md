# Tanks
Created throughout the month of April 2020. One versus one java game. 

To begin, download the zip file and unzip.
From terminal, find downloaded folder (should be named Tanks-master).
Once in the folder, enter this command "javac *.java" followed by "java Main" to run the program.

These commands will bring you to the game screen. 
From there, there are two sets of controls for the two players. 

The first group of controls control player 1, or the player on the left. The user can use
the keys WASD to move and space to shoot the bullet. 

The second group of
controls control player 2, or the player on the right. The user can use the arrow keys
to move and shift to shoot the bullet. 

Next to your health will show "Ready to Fire" which is visible when the player is reloaded and ready to fire. 

This program will continue until one player has no health left. Then, a game over screen will appear. If the users want to play again, press enter to restart the game.
